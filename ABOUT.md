The about page should include four sections: About MPL, Meet the Team, Our Offerings, and Contact Us. More details about each section are included below. Whenever text is listed in quotes, make sure not to change the content and use it directly on the website.

### About MPL
This section should be simple, opening the about page with a clear introduction to the website. The following text should be used:
"Hello, my name is Ria, and I am the developer of the Match Point League (MPL) site. This website is designed with the intention of bringing together players across Baltimore to form a friendly (and competitive!) community. Please take your time to explore our range of offerings for players of all backgrounds."


### Meet the Team
This section should display a profile photo, name, role, and bio for each of the team members. Use the following information without changing any of the text. Use the headshots in the src/assets directory.
- ðŸŽ¾ Marco
Role: "Founder & League Visionary"
Bio: "Born and raised in Italy, Marco was a skilled soccer player before moving to the U.S. at 21 â€” where tennis became his new passion. After years of playing and joining local leagues, he began dreaming of a smarter, more intuitive way for players to connect. When his tennis buddy Frank started playing pickleball and raving about it, the idea struck: why not build the first-ever platform for both tennis and pickleball matchmaking? And just like that, Match Point League was born."

- ðŸ§  Frank
Role: "Co-founder & Strategic Architect"
Bio: "With razor-sharp technical insight and a mind for structure, Frank was instrumental in shaping the platform behind the scenes. His early experience with pickleball planted the seed for a dual-sport concept, and his high-level input on the platformâ€™s technologies, flow, and features helped turn vision into reality. MPLâ€™s foundation is built on Frankâ€™s strategy."

- ðŸ’» Ria
Role: "Lead Developer & UX Strategist"
Bio: "Ria brought the MPL platform to life with incredible skill and ease. A tech wizard fluent in the latest technologies, she tackled everything from matchmaking algorithms to game-day scheduling and responsive design. Her sharp UX instincts and flawless backend execution created the smooth, modern experience players love today."

- ðŸ“£ Sherie
Role: "Marketing Director & Brand Voice"
Bio: "Sherie helped shape how MPL connects with the world. She guided the user interface with a sharp eye for clarity and cohesion, while building targeted outreach to bring the right players onto the platform. With her experience in digital marketing and community growth, Sherie made sure MPL didnâ€™t just launch â€” it landed strong."
