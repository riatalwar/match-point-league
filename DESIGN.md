The Match Point League (MPL) website should be clean, intuitive, and professional, prioritizing user experience and mobile responsiveness. Prioritize the home page styling, but make sure that the styles and colors are consistent across the website. The home page should include a static background image with the individual content blocks scrolling over it. More details for colors, layout, and buttons are listed below.

1. Color Palette
Use a modern, sport-inspired color scheme that feels both energized and neutral. Think cool-toned blues, subtle grays, with strategic pops of neon lime green, or electric yellow to reflect tennis and pickleball energy—without overwhelming the eye. And of course bright, glossy pearl white and black 

2. Clean, Uncluttered Layout
The site structure should feel open, breathable, and easy to navigate. Avoid visual clutter. When content doesn't fit within a section, prioritize vertical scrolling over cramming elements together.

3. Mobile-Friendly Scrolling
The scroll interface should be:
- Clearly visible
- Easy to engage with, especially on mobile devices
- Smooth and responsiveMake sure scroll bars are well-padded and not hidden.

4. Visual Shapes & Consistency
- Square or rectangular images are fine.
- All other elements (buttons, icons, avatars) should feature rounded corners or circular shapes to visually echo tennis and pickleball balls.
- Use perfect circles when possible for avatars, profile icons, and loading animations.
5. Typography That Pops
Choose two complementary fonts: one bold and distinctive for headers, another clean and legible for body text.
These should convey modern athleticism while remaining user-friendly and professional.

6. Profile Photo Design
In both the Players section and user profiles, uploaded photos should display in a circular format.
If no photo is uploaded, display a default player silhouette, which varies by:
Gender (male, female, or nonbinary)
Team format (singles/doubles)
⚠️ Consider using illustrated outlines or grayscale icons—simple but distinct.

7. Clear, Action-Oriented Buttons
All clickable buttons should describe their function explicitly. Avoid vague labels like “Click Here.”Use phrasing like:
- “📅 Schedule a Match”
- “📝 Register for a League”
- “➕ Add a New Court”
- “🔍 View Available Courts”
