            <p>
              Hello, my name is Ria, and I am the developer of the Match Point League (MPL) site. 
              This website is designed with the intention of bringing together players across Baltimore 
              to form a friendly (and competitive!) community. Please take your time to explore our 
              range of offerings for players of all backgrounds.

                <h3>üéæ Marco</h3>
                <p className="member-role">Founder & League Visionary</p>
                <p className="member-bio">
                  Born and raised in Italy, Marco was a skilled soccer player before moving to the U.S. at 21 ‚Äî where tennis became his new passion. After years of playing and joining local leagues, he began dreaming of a smarter, more intuitive way for players to connect. When his tennis buddy Frank started playing pickleball and raving about it, the idea struck: why not build the first-ever platform for both tennis and pickleball matchmaking? And just like that, Match Point League was born.

                <p className="member-bio">
                  With razor-sharp technical insight and a mind for structure, Frank was instrumental in shaping the platform behind the scenes. His early experience with pickleball planted the seed for a dual-sport concept, and his high-level input on the platform's technologies, flow, and features helped turn vision into reality. MPL's foundation is built on Frank's strategy.
